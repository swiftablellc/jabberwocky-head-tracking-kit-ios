### CAUTION
* MODIFYING any EngineInterface files has a high likelihood of causing ARKitEngine to fail.
* These files are used to build the Engine framework binaries and should be regarded with extreme caution, small changes can have pretty drastic effects.
* In the future, when the JabberwockyHTKit is stable the EngineInterface will likely be moved to a separate framework.
